            Hi, welcome to my website! My name is Edwin and I am a high-school student from Canada. 
            2004 was the year I was born and ever since I have been attempting to quench my never-ending 
            thirst for knowledge. I even enrolled in TEJ4U0 to that end! This page will help you get to 
            know a little more about me and who I am.

            I like to try new things. I feel that doing so builds character and is the only way you can know 
            if you like something. Albert Einstein once said; “A person who never made a mistake never tried 
            anything new”. This quote really stuck with me as I am a strong believer in the idea that we learn 
            from our mistakes so if I never try anything new, I am really missing out on the opportunity to learn.

            Being active takes a toll on your body, so after coming home and freshening up, I like to play video games. I started my 
            “gaming career” off with Fortnite when my parents bought us a PlayStation 4 for Christmas 2018. Since then, I have broadened 
            my video game interest to Call of Duty, Minecraft, Battlefront II, and Save The World. Paradoxically, the pandemic has made me 
            play video games less and now I mainly play Call of Duty as I can. I also play chess. I first learned about chess from my dad 
            years ago but now I have gotten into it more than ever. I play on chess.com and my rating has increased from 800 to 1200 in 
            the past few months. (1800 now)

            After high school, I want to study at the University of Toronto in the Engineering Sciences program and major in Aerospace Engineering. 
            This is no easy task as the program is very competitive so I am working hard so that I can achieve my goals. After graduation from the 
            program, I may or may not be interested in a master’s degree to broaden my horizons. After graduation, I will seek a job at prestigious 
            companies whose work interests me. Such companies include NASA, SpaceX, and Lockheed Martin.
