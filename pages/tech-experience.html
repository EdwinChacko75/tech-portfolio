            I have strong tech design skills and can create visually appealing graphics for any occasion. I applied this skill to create a 
            wixsite for my charity and am working on a logo for my business at the moment. Problem-solving is something that I am strong in 
            and have applied that skill countless times in chess and math. A funny story that relates to my problem solving happened in 
            grade 10 business when we were given a work period and my teacherâ€™s coffee tumbler got stuck. My friends spent the greater half 
            of the period trying to fix it while I was working and then I gave it a shot and solved the issue immediately!

            I don't have any coding experience but would like to develop some as I truly think I can be a great coder. My math skills in 
            conjunction with my problem-solving skills make quite the team in creating the best lines of code ever witnessed by man. I lied, 
            I have a long way to go till I get there, but get there I will. Aerospace engineers need to have strong coding skills as it is 
            something that is often involved in the development and testing of aircraft and their respective parts. If I am to be a good 
            aerospace engineer, I must have good coding skills. And so I embark on this journey to coding master, HTML in my right hand and 
            CSS in the left.
